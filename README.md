Project Huler repository
========================

Two cousins, two brains, one mechanical engineer, one chemist. We are **Project Huler!**

Here you'll find some code to solve problems posed on the fun mathematics
website [Project Euler](projecteuler.net). We code in Python, R, C, and C#.
We're always looking to improve our craft. For those who don't want their
Project Euler experience spoiled, we'd suggest you not look further in the
repository.
