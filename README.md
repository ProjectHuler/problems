Project Huler repository
========================

Two cousins, two brains, one mechanical engineer, one chemist. We are **Project Huler!**

Here you'll find some code to solve problems posed on the fun mathematics
website [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). We code in Python, R, C, and
C#. We're always looking to improve our craft. For those who don't want their
Project Euler experience spoiled, we'd suggest you not look further in the
repository.

Running the Code
----------------
### Python
Python code can be simply run on the command line by typing
   ```
   $> python <filename>.py
   ```

### C
C code will need to be compiled before it can be run. Try
   ```
   $> gcc -std=c99 <filename>.c
   $> ./a.out
   ```

### R
To run R code:

1.  Install and launch R at [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)
2.  Open *.R file with console
3.  Place cursor in the editing window (not R Console)
4.  From top menu:  Edit -> Run All 
5.  Outputs should now be printed inside the R Console window
